                    Lady Whistledown’s Society Papers<br>14th July, 2025<br>Kolkata Edition
                </p>
                <p>Dearest Readers,</p>
                <p>
                It is not often that one is rendered quite speechless in this city of endless chatter and scandal — but today, this author must confess to a flutter of genuine delight. The social event of the coming season has officially been confirmed, and it is no mere garden variety nuptial, no quiet temple affair. Indeed, the families Ghosh and Banerjee have declared their grandest of intentions, and society shall never be the same again. Miss Anushka Ghosh, a lady of wit, grace, and enviable poise, is soon to be wed to the dashing and ever-enigmatic Mr. Suharto Banerjee. The date for this most promising of unions? None other than the day of love itself — 14th February, 2026. But do not presume this to be a mere one-day affair. In true Indian tradition (and with all the flair one has come to expect from the finest Bengali households), the celebration shall extend over five glorious days — a veritable festival of love, music, rituals, and revelry. From mehendi to sangeet, haldi to the pheras, and the inevitable midnight gossip that follows each — this wedding promises to be nothing short of legendary. All events shall take place in the ever-vibrant city of Kolkata, India — where every street corner smells of mishti and revolution, and the air itself seems to hum with anticipation. This author has it on very good authority that every recipient of this letter is cordially invited to attend — with their chosen partners, of course (for what is love, if not something to be shared?). So dust off your finest silks and brocade, polish those heirloom jhumkas, and prepare for five days of unmatched celebration. For while weddings may be common, a Ghosh-Banerjee alliance is anything but. Until then, I shall keep my quill sharp and my ears open — for love may be in the air, but gossip is never far behind. 
                </p>
                <p>Yours most curiously, <br>—Lady Whistledown</p>
